**Response from ChatGPT 3.5:** \
The concept of money itself is not inherently corrupting; rather, it's the way in which humans often prioritize and pursue wealth that can lead to unethical behavior. Money can incentivize greed, materialism, and a focus on personal gain at the expense of others. However, it can also serve as a tool for economic exchange, investment, and societal progress when used responsibly. Whether money corrupts individuals depends on their values, ethics, and how they choose to wield financial power. Ultimately, it's the choices and actions of individuals that determine whether money has a corrupting influence or not.

### Few-Shot Prompting:

**Prompt:** \
*Q: Am I a Human?* \
*A: According to articles published by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the concept of personal identity is complex and there is no consensus on what defines a person. Some argue that personal identity is based on both mental and physical continuity, while others suggest that it is determined by causal dependence. Additionally, the question of what matters in identity is also debated, with some proposing that being a human person is based on being an organism. However, being an organism does not necessarily mean being a human person. Therefore, whether or not you are a human depends on how personal identity is defined, and there is no definitive answer provided in the extract.*

*Q: How does one become a "good person"?* \
*A: According to articles published by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, becoming a "good person" involves various aspects. Hume defines a "good person" as someone who possesses virtues such as goodwill, generosity, and love. Kant argues that everyone has a duty to be helpful to others. Some philosophers believe that beneficent actions are virtuous and commendable. Gert's theory suggests that the goal of morality is to minimize harm rather than promote good. Singer argues for striving to donate a percentage of income. Murphy proposes fixing limits for large-scale problems as cooperative projects. The concept of being a "good person" is multifaceted and encompasses different perspectives and theories in philosophy.*

*Q: Is morality developed within a culture, or is it intrinsic?* \
*A: According to articles published by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, morality is understood as a set of social rules, principles, and norms that guide people's conduct. Moral philosophers do not believe that the results of their reflective activities are limited to their own societies. In African ethics, morality is considered intrinsic to the conception of a person, and character is acquired through performing good actions. Some scholars argue that there is a connection between religion and morality in African ethics, but the sources of African morality are independent of religious prescriptions. On the other hand, moral relativism, which gained prominence in the twentieth century, suggests that moral judgments are relative to the moral code of a society. Proponents of moral relativism focus on the distinctive features of morality and reject general relativism. There is ongoing debate about whether morality is developed within a culture or if it is intrinsic. *

**Prompt:** has the concept of money corrupted humans? 

**Response from ThinkAI:**
According to articles published by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the concept of money has been subject to intense moral scrutiny and ethical debate. Traditional ethicists held a negative attitude towards activities related to money and finance. Aristotle argued that desiring money as an end in itself is unnatural. In Ancient and Medieval times, societies typically condemned or banned the practice of usury. The financial crisis of 2008 was caused by widespread speculation on risky derivatives, which is seen as a result of the myopia of finance. Money and finance have been associated with corruption, as there is often a close relationship between corruption and human rights violations. Corruption is the abuse of power by a public official for private gain, and it can have a corrupting effect on a person's character. However, the concept of corruption is not clearly demarcated within the broader class of immoral actions. The prevalence of economic discourse in society, particularly in Britain, may reflect its hegemonic influence. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is considered a definitive work in economics, but socialist economic thought emerged in the 19th century. There is no single definition of economics, but Aristotle identified the functional properties of money. The rise of game theory in mainstream economics can be seen as a revival of quantitative efforts to measure population or the money supply. Overall, the concept of money has been associated with both corruption and economic development, and its impact on human behavior is a complex and debated topic.
